How to create a canned MMS PDU for Netsim from a .mms file 
------------------------------------------------------------

a) Netsim relies on a file named StoredMMS.bin for MMS loopback and MMS 
submission. This file is created by Netsim while doing MMS loopback.

b) Take the .mms file and open it in a hex editor, eg. the hex editor 
provided by Visual Studio 6.  Now, you need to transform this to 
StoredMMS.bin by adding the HTTP part at the start.

c) If the .mms file is less than 2 to 3 KB then prepend the simple header in 
mms_StandardHTTPHeader.bin at the beginning of the .mms file and save the result 
as StoredMMS.bin. 

d) If the MMS is larger then Netsim will send it in chunks of 2048 bytes at a 
time.  In that case, you need to prepend the chunked HTTP header given by 
mms_ChunkedHTTPHeader.bin. 

e) Once StoredMMS.bin is created you can use the 'Canned MMS Pdu' option in Netsim
to generate and send a push message.  

Note that StoredMMS.bin will get overwritten if you send a MMS from PhoneSim
in netsim loopback mode.
